This project is an opportunity to earn some extra credit for this class. We'll be awarding a laptop, kindly gifted by Microsoft, to the student who has the best submission.

The project is a one-page specification describing a software product: either a mobile app, a website, or a Desktop app that runs on a Mac or PC.  The product can be whatever you choose: use your imagination! Just be sure to follow this format...

- A short paragraph naming the product and describing the purpose and the target market.

- A bullet point list of features. (like you would see in the App Store)

- A sketch of the user interface. You should do this with pen & paper and either scan it or take a picture with your phone and send it to us along with your submission. Describe what's going on in your sketches.

- A description and pseudocode of how you'd apply a concept learned in Intro to Comp Sci (such as a loop, or sorting) to solve a problem in your program.

I've included a sample specification for a simple timer app. Only those that complete all four parts will be eligible. Submissions will be due by June 12, and we'll announce the winner on the last day of class, Monday June 15. Good luck!
