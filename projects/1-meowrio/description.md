#Project 1: Super Meow-rio
The purpose of this project is to familiarize yourself with Scratch by implementing a simplified version of Super Mario Bros. You will write a program to move the Scratch Cat (Meow-rio!) around a level, jump, and hit a coin block.

#Due
End of Class Monday, March 2 to tealsteachers@gmail.com

#Part 1: Setup (5)
- Place the provided coin block sprite and backdrop on the stage. (5)

#Part 2: Walking (35)
- Meow-rio moves to the right when the right arrow is pressed. (10)
- Meow-rio moves to the left when the left arrow is pressed. (10)
- Movement should look natural: the Meow-rio should have a walking animation while moving and face the correct direction. (15)

#Part 3: Jumping (45)
- Meow-rio jumps when the space bar is pressed. (10)
- If Meow-rio hits the question block while jumping, the provided coin sound effect plays and the block animates. (20)
- Movement should look natural: Meow-rio should animate into a jump and then look natural after landing. (15)

#Coding Style (15)
- Sprites should have proper names. (5)
- There are no unused blocks in the scripts area. (5)
- There is a comment for every keyboard input. (5)

# Extra Credit (10)
- Add a second block which spawns a magic mushroom with a sound effect when hit. The mushroom should move to the right and drop to the ground, and if Meow-rio touches it he should grow and the power-up sound plays. (10)
