# HTML Lesson

### Part 1

1. Copy the code in my_website.html, paste it into a Notepad
2. Save the file as my_website.html
2. Find that file on the computer and open it. It should open in a web browser (like Chrome or Internet Explorer)

### Part 2
Your job is to edit the HTML file to make your own website. 
To check to see what the changes you made did, just refresh the webpage in the browser. 
If you have questions, the first thing to do is Google them. For instance, if you don't know how to change the background color, 
then type into Google "How to change website's background color" and you will find a wealth of information.
