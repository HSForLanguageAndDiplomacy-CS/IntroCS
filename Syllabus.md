#### What to Expect: 

In this class, you will:

* **Learn** the basic programming concepts that are fundamental to being able to code in any language. 
* **See** some beautiful applications of computing that have changed the world.
* **Discuss** current events related to technology.

We will be using a visual programming language called Scratch that was developed at MIT. Classes will revolve around learning or reviewing a couple of key topics (~10 minutes), and working on programming projects to apply those principles (~30 minutes). **You will not need your own computer and no previous knowledge of programming is required.**


#### Class Rules: 

* **Attendance:** Lessons will be taught at the beginning of class so **please be on time**! The standard school attendance policy applies. 

* **Cheating:** 
  - Looking up documentation online in **OK**
  - Brainstorming with a friend is **OK**
  - Having a friend type on your computer is **NOT OK**
  - Telling someone exactly what to type is **NOT OK**
  - Sending someone else your code or copying another person's code is **NOT OK**

#### How You Will Be Graded:
Your grade will be composed of four parts: homework, projects, quizzes and class participation. There will be weekly current event assignments and a quiz at the end of each unit.
