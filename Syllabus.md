In this class, you will:

* **Learn** the basic programming concepts that are fundamental to being able to code in any language. 
* **See** some beautiful applications of computing that have changed the world.
* **Discuss** current events related to technology.

We will be using a visual programming language called Scratch that was developed at MIT. Classes will revolve around learning or reviewing a couple of key topics (~10 minutes), and working on programming projects to apply those principles (~30 minutes). You do not need your own compute and **no previous knowledge of computer science or programming is required.**
